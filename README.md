# My Experiments in Computer Graphics
> A vertex here, a vertex there, one up there and... *et voil√†*, a new triangle!

This repository (should) hold my experiments with OpenGL and DirectX; actually there is
only one project but I am working on it.
I don't think to be the best developer in the world, but I still hope that my code is
readable in the case you want to dive in.
